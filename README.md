# Case Study Caesar Cipher
 
In this Case Study I have implemented Caesar Cipher using Python. 

A Caesar cipher shifts each letter of a message to another letter in the alphabet located a fixed distance from the original letter. If our encryption key were 1, we would shift **h** to the next letter **i**, **i** to the next letter **j**, and so on. If we reach the end of the alphabet, which for us is the space character, we simply loop back to a. To decode the message, we make a similar shift, except we move the same number of steps backwards in the alphabet.
